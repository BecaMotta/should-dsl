To install should_dsl you just need to have setuptools installed (it's a dependency).

There is just a little step to install should_dsl, and it is:
$ python setup.py install # maybe you must be root

Now you can use should_dsl!

If you don't have setuptools installed or don't want to download it, you can just copy the should_dsl.py file to your python site-packages directory.
For example:
$ cp should_dsl.py /usr/lib/python2.5/lib/site-packages

Enjoy it!
